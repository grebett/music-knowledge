_A Film Scoring Masterclass from Guildhall's Electronic Music Department, a dynamic masterclass focusing on the recording and production of a hybrid film score using both virtual and real instruments with Apple Logic Pro X._

_Hosted by Guildhall professor Jono Buchanan and joined by musicians on stage, this masterclass takes you through a complete production workflow from composing, arranging and recording, to editing and mixing._

üí≠ My opinion: A very interesting end to end scoring demo of a short action film. Using samples and lives musicians along. Very good insights and tips about Logic Pro X.
